Partition size
===============

Number of values(cell - key,value pairs) in a partition - 2 Billion (100's of MB size)

Formula
-------


1. No. for values = No. of rows x ( No. of columns - No. of Primary Key - No. of static column) + No. of static column (if ( No. of columns - No. of Primary Key - No. of static column) != 0)


2. No. for values = No. of rows  + No. of static column (if ( No. of columns - No. of Primary Key - No. of static column) == 0)



Partition size
===============
sum of PK datatype size + sum of static column datatype size + No. of rows in the table 
  X sum of each colum( each normal colum size + sum of clustering column datatype size) + 8(every cell has timestamp in cassandra)
  X No. of values from previous formula


Data Duplication
----------------
Avoid non constant duplication factor

Data consistency
-----------------
In C* you cannot update primary key value
Use Batch for set of queries for consistency

Client side joins
-----------------
Never use it, If you can avoid it
use query efficiently


Transaction
-----------
Lightweight transactions - check condition and perform Insert/Update/Delete

Insert ... IF NOT EXISTS

Expensive then normal read/write


Aggregation
===========

count()

concurrent access - update
 use light weight transaction to ensure data - failed LWT must be retried
 Or do better data modeling
